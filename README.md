# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a workday scheduler. Utilizing day.js and jquery, time slots will change based on current time of day. 
The current day will display at the top. The time box will change colors based on time of day. Time slots in the past will be gray. Current time slot will be red. Future time slots will be green. As tasks are added to time slots and save button pushed, that information will remain in the time slot. 

## Acceptance Criteria

- [] When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top
- [] Time blocks are presented from 9am through 5pm
- [] Each time block is color coded (past: gray, present: red, future: green)
- [] A user can enter events in the text area for each time slot
- [] When the save button is pressed after entering or deleting text in the time slot, the information persists on refresh


## Expected Outcome

A daily scheduler showing current date that is color coded based on time of day and saves events until deleted.
